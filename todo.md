IDEAS:

i like this one "virus scan for your digital health"
- Digital Environment Audit & Optimization: The AI can prompt users to analyze their digital habits (e.g., most used apps, common distractions) and then offer personalized, actionable advice on optimizing device settings, app usage, and notification management to reduce digital "friction."
 
- "Future Self" Precommitment Planner: A guided AI flow where users explicitly define a future action they want to commit to (e.g., "avoid social media for 2 hours after waking"). The AI helps articulate the why, identify potential triggers, and brainstorm specific precommitment strategies (e.g., "put phone in a different room," "use a physical lockbox").
