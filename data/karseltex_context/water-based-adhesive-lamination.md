# Water-Based Adhesive Lamination Process

Water-based adhesive lamination is an eco-friendly process that uses water-based chemical adhesives to bond foam to fabric surfaces. This method provides excellent adhesion for automotive upholstery fabric, headliner fabric, and car fabric while being more environmentally conscious.

## Process Overview

This lamination technique uses water-based chemical adhesives to create strong bonds between foam and fabric materials. The process is designed to be both effective and environmentally responsible for car upholstery fabric, auto fabric, and automotive headliner fabric production.

## Key Benefits

- **Increased Durability**: Enhanced car fabric strength and longevity
- **Enhanced Weight**: Improved fabric weight characteristics for automotive applications
- **Increased Thickness**: Customizable thickness from 2mm to 15mm for headliner fabric and car roof ceiling
- **Cost-Effective**: More economical due to lower density foam usage compared to flame lamination
- **Improved Softness**: Enhanced soft feel and comfort for car seat fabric and automotive upholstery fabric
- **Eco-Friendly**: Water-based adhesives are more environmentally conscious

## Applications

Our water-based adhesive lamination is perfect for:
- Automotive headliner fabric and car roof ceiling applications
- Car upholstery fabric and automotive upholstery fabric production
- Car seat fabric and auto fabric manufacturing
- Suede headliner and ceiling fabric applications
- Car cover fabric production
- Boat interior fabric applications
- Baby product manufacturing
- Footwear production

## Technical Specifications

- **Maximum Width**: Up to 200 cm for all car fabric and automotive upholstery fabric types
- **Foam Thickness Range**: 2 mm to 15 mm with foam and felt backing for auto applications
- **Adhesive Type**: Water-based chemical adhesives
- **Economic Advantage**: Lower density foam usage reduces costs for headliner fabric production

## Environmental Benefits

This process uses water-based adhesives, making it a more sustainable choice compared to solvent-based alternatives while maintaining excellent performance standards for automotive headliner fabric, car upholstery fabric, and other auto fabric applications.
