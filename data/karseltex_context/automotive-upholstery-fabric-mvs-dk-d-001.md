    title: "Why Automotive Upholstery Fabric is Needed"
    content: |
      Regardless of your car's age, you may encounter wear and tear on your upholstery from time to time. This can be caused by:
      
      - Cigarette burns
      - Stitching issues
      - Wiping with wet cloth
      - Wrong chemical cleaning products
      
      Fabrics used for car seat upholstery often use adhesives that aren't water-resistant. Therefore, those who clean the upholstery with a wet cloth or the wrong chemicals can experience wear and tear over time.
      
      To prevent wear and tear on the seat upholstery, we recommend using seat covers made of fabric and tailored to your taste, suitable for the make and model of your vehicle.
