    title: "Professional Installation Process"
    content: |
      Headliner installation is a skilled process that requires expertise:
      
      1. **Preparation**: Remove old headliner and clean the surface
      2. **Adhesive Application**: Apply adhesive using compressor equipment
      3. **Fabric Installation**: Carefully position and secure the fabric
      4. **Trimming**: Cut necessary openings for lights, vents, and other fixtures
      5. **Electrical Connections**: Connect required electrical components
      6. **Final Assembly**: Install door seals and other trim pieces
      7. **Quality Check**: Ensure proper fit and finish
      
      **DIY vs Professional Installation**
      
      While some may attempt DIY repairs using methods like syringe application of adhesives, we recommend professional installation for best results. DIY methods may result in:
      - Uneven adhesion
      - Visible repair marks
      - Temporary solutions that may fail over time
      
      Professional installation ensures proper adhesion, clean appearance, and long-lasting results.
