    title: "Why Automotive Headliner Fabric is Needed"
    content: |
      Automotive headliner fabric may sag over time due to various factors:
      
      - Age of the vehicle
      - Moisture exposure from cleaning with wet cloth
      - Use of incorrect chemical cleaning products
      - Breakdown of water-resistant adhesives
      
      The headliner fabrics used in automobiles typically use water-resistant adhesives. When people clean the ceiling with a wet cloth or incorrect chemical products, they may encounter sagging problems over time.

    title: "Common Repair Methods"
    content: |
      When faced with sagging headliner issues, many people seek DIY repair solutions. One of the most commonly suggested methods is using Japanese adhesive with a syringe. However, before attempting this method, consider:
      
      - The area beneath where you apply the adhesive may not be suitable for bonding, causing the adhesive to fail
      - The adhesive-applied area may appear stiff and wet compared to other regions

    title: "Professional Installation Process"
    content: |
      During the headliner installation process, adhesive is applied using a compressor device and the fabric undergoes specific procedures. This work requires expertise and we recommend having it done by a professional. After the bonding process is complete, necessary openings are cut in the fabric. The finished headliner is then installed in the vehicle, with electrical connections made first, followed by door seals and other fitting adjustments.
      
      Headliner repair is a job that requires expertise. If you're not confident in your abilities, we strongly recommend having the repair done by a professional.
