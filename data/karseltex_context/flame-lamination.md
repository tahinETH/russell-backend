# Flame Lamination Process

Flame lamination is a process of bonding foam to fabric using flame technology. This advanced manufacturing technique provides superior adhesion and enhanced material properties for automotive upholstery fabric, headliner fabric, and various car fabric applications.

## Process Overview

Flame lamination involves using controlled flame to bond foam materials to fabric surfaces. This creates a strong, durable bond that enhances the fabric's performance characteristics, making it ideal for car upholstery fabric, auto fabric, and automotive headliner fabric production.

## Key Benefits

- **Increased Durability**: The car fabric's strength and longevity are significantly enhanced
- **Enhanced Weight**: Improved fabric weight for better performance in automotive applications
- **Increased Thickness**: Fabric thickness can be customized from 2mm to 20mm for car roof ceiling and headliner fabric
- **Washability**: Auto fabric maintains its washable properties after lamination
- **Improved Softness**: Enhanced soft feel and comfort for car seat fabric and automotive upholstery fabric

## Applications

Our flame lamination process is ideal for:
- Automotive headliner fabric and car roof ceiling applications
- Car upholstery fabric and automotive upholstery fabric
- Car seat fabric and suede headliner production
- Auto fabric for various automotive interior components
- Boat interior fabric applications
- Home textile applications
- Footwear manufacturing
- Apparel production

## Technical Specifications

- **Maximum Width**: Up to 200 cm for all car fabric and automotive upholstery fabric types
- **Foam Thickness Range**: 2 mm to 20 mm with foam and felt backing for auto applications
- **Compatible Materials**: Wide range of headliner fabric, car cover fabric, and automotive fabric types with various foam densities
