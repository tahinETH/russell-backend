    title: "Product Overview"
    content: |
      Our felt-backed automotive design fabric addresses areas where lycra-enhanced flexible fabric alone may be insufficient. By adding felt backing to fabric with the same properties, flexibility is reduced while durability is increased, making the fabric thicker and more robust.
      
      Every customer has different preferences according to their specific usage purposes. Therefore, if a customer selects a color from our color chart one day and prefers a different color the next day, we provide production according to customer preferences from dozens of options.
